# WIP
Rewrite of my [cinematic camera avatar](https://github.com/lexize/LCamera). I decided to rewrite it to make it at least a bit structured, make [LUtils](https://github.com/lexize/lutils) usage optional, and just update it so it will use LUtils rewrite.

Current progress:
* Animation track: done (testing)
* Camera: planned
* UI: planned
* Path creation/editing/saving/loading: planned
